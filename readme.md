# Visa Document Processing MVP

This repository contains a minimal example of a full stack application for processing visa documents. The backend is implemented with **Flask** and the frontend is a simple HTML page. The application accepts PDF files, extracts their text and returns a short summary.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` and upload a PDF document to see the summary generated by the backend.

This MVP demonstrates a possible approach for automating document processing that could be extended with more advanced AI models.
